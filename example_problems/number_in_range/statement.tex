\section{Problem Description}

You are given two integers, $l$ and $h$ ($l \leq h$).  Your goal is to
find the smallest integer $n$ such that $l \leq n \leq h$.

\section{Input Format}

The first line of input contains a single integer $l$ ($1 \leq l \leq 100$).

The second line of input contains a single integer $h$ ($1 \leq h \leq 100$).

An example input is given below.  Note that this input contains
comments for your understanding, valid inputs should not contain any
comments.

\begin{verbatim}
1                // l = 1
5                // h = 5
\end{verbatim}

\section{Output Format}

The output should contain exactly $1$ line containing only the value
$n$.

For example, a solution to the input above is shown below.  Again, the
comments in this example are for your understanding only.  Valid
outputs should not contain extra comments or spaces.

\begin{verbatim}
4               // n = 4
\end{verbatim}

Note that a better solution exists with only $n = 1$.  An output does
not need to be optimal to be valid.
